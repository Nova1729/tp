# CCAttendance
CCAttendance is a desktop app for managing attendance of students in CCAs, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, CCAttendance can get your attendance management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Features
CCAttendance allows you to:
  1. Add students to the list of students
  2. Add CCAs to the list of CCAs
  3. Record attendance of students in CCAs
  4. Assign roles to students in CCAs
  5. Many more!

To see the full list of features, refer to the [User Guide](https://ay2425s2-cs2103t-t09-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html).
